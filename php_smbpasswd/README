This is a web interface that allows an user of a Samba Domain to change his/her
password. It is very useful if you are running a NT domain without using LDAP
as back-end for the accounts.
The project is divided in two parts: a daemon written in C: it opens a UNIX
socket inside the filesystem listening for connections coming from a client
(in this project the client is the PHP web interface).

The daemon needs to be setuid'ed because he needs to launch smbpasswd as root
user. A very simple php web interface that talks with the daemon. this interface
implements a catpcha system. 

The project is very embryonic, i wrote it to satisfy my personal needs.
I suggest to do a chmod 700 of the daemon.

              tell real people from bots.
